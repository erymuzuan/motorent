# Scooter GLB (low-poly)

This folder contains a simple script that generates a low-poly scooter GLB (glTF 2.0 binary).

Files:
- `scooter.glb` - (generated by running the script)
- `create-scooter-glb.js` - Node.js script that procedurally builds the model and writes `assets/scooter/scooter.glb`

How to generate:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (>= 14).
2. Run:

```powershell
node scripts/create-scooter-glb.js
```

3. Open `assets/scooter/scooter.glb` in a glTF viewer such as https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/ or in your 3D tool.

Notes:
- The generated model is intentionally simple (flat, low-poly) and intended as a starting point. If you'd like, I can refine the geometry, add colors/textures, or produce a higher-poly version.
