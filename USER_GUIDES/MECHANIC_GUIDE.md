# MotoRent Mechanic Guide

As a Mechanic, your focus is on the health and safety of the fleet.

## 1. Fleet Health Monitoring
- **All Vehicles**: View the status of every motorbike in the fleet. Look for bikes marked as **"Maintenance"**.
- **Mileage Tracking**: Monitor current mileage to anticipate scheduled service needs.

## 2. Maintenance Workflow
- **Service Types**: Configure standard maintenance tasks (e.g., Oil Change, Tire Replacement, Brake Check).
- **Maintenance Schedules**: Define mileage or time-based intervals for different vehicle models.
- **Service Locations**: Manage a list of authorized service centers or internal workshops.

## 3. Handling Damage
- **Damage Reports**: Review damage reports submitted by staff during check-outs.
- **Photos**: View "Before" and "After" photos to assess structural or cosmetic issues.
- **Repair Tracking**: Once a bike is repaired, update its status from "Maintenance" back to "Available" so it can be rented again.

*Safety First: Ensure all safety-critical maintenance (brakes, tires, lights) is logged before returning a vehicle to the "Available" pool.*
