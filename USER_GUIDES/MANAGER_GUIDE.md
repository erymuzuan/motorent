# MotoRent Manager Guide

Welcome to the MotoRent Management Dashboard. As a Manager (OrgAdmin or ShopManager), you have oversight of your shop's fleet, finances, and operational settings.

## 1. Dashboard Overview
The Management Dashboard (/manager) provides a high-level view of your business performance:
- **KPI Metrics**: Real-time tracking of Today's Revenue, Active Rentals, Returns Due Today, and Fleet Utilization.
- **Revenue Trends**: Visual charts showing revenue growth over 7, 30, or 90 days.
- **Fleet Status**: A breakdown of your motorbikes (Rented, Available, Maintenance, Reserved).
- **Recent Activity**: A timeline of actions taken by staff and system events.

## 2. Fleet Management
Manage your assets efficiently under the **Fleet** menu:
- **All Vehicles**: View and manage your entire fleet. You can add new motorbikes, update their status (e.g., move to maintenance), and track mileage.
- **Accessories**: Manage rental add-ons like helmets, phone holders, and rain gear. Set daily rates and track available quantities.

## 3. Financial Oversight
Track the money flow under the **Finance** menu:
- **Payments**: A searchable list of all transactions (Rental, Insurance, Accessory, Damage, etc.).
- **Deposits**: Track security deposits held, refunded, or forfeited.
- **Owner Payments**: If you manage third-party owned vehicles, calculate and track payments due to owners based on daily rates or revenue share.
- **Reports**: Generate revenue summaries and operational reports to analyze shop performance.

## 4. Operational Settings
Configure your shop's "Rules of the Game" under the **Settings** menu:
- **Insurance**: Group and manage insurance packages (Basic, Premium, Full Coverage) with coverage limits and deductibles.
- **Shop Settings**: Update your shop's contact info, logo, and terms & conditions.
- **Operating Schedule**: Define your weekly opening hours and out-of-hours fee bands.
- **Vehicle Pools**: Configure shared inventory between multiple shop locations.

## 5. Handling Incidents
- **Accidents**: Monitor accident reports submitted by staff. Review document photos, costs, and notes related to any fleet damage.
- **Damage Reports**: Review damage documented during check-outs and track recovery costs.
