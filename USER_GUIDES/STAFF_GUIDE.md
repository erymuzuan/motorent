# MotoRent Staff Guide

This guide covers the daily operations for front-desk staff. Your primary goal is to provide a smooth check-in and check-out experience for tourists.

## 1. Staff Dashboard
The Staff Dashboard (/staff) is designed for quick actions:
- **New Check-In**: Start a new rental session.
- **Return Bike**: Process a returning vehicle.
- **Active Rentals**: View all currently rented bikes.
- **Overdue**: Quickly see which rentals missed their return time.
- **Due Today**: A prioritized list of returns expected today.

## 2. Check-In Process (The Wizard)
When a customer arrives to rent a bike, use the **New Check-In** button. This follows a 5-step wizard:
1. **Rental Details**: Select the shop, duration type (Daily or Fixed Interval), and dates.
2. **Customer Registration**: 
    - Search for existing customers or register a new one.
    - **OCR Feature**: Use the camera to take a photo of the Renter's Passport or ID. The system (powered by Gemini AI) will automatically extract their name, ID number, and nationality.
3. **Vehicle & Options**: Select an available motorbike, insurance package, and any accessories (helmets, etc.).
4. **Agreement & Signature**: Read the terms to the customer. They must sign directly on the screen (touch-friendly).
5. **Payment & Review**: Record the rental payment and the security deposit (Cash or Card).

## 3. Processing Returns (Check-Out)
When a bike is returned:
1. Locate the rental in the **Due Today** list or via **Return Bike**.
2. **Standard Check**: Record the return mileage and end date.
3. **Damage Inspection**: 
    - Check the bike for new scratches or damages.
    - If damage is found, create a **Damage Report** with photos and estimated costs.
4. **Deposit Refund**: The system calculates if any amount should be deducted from the deposit for damages or late returns. Process the refund to the customer.

## 4. Customer Management
- **Renters**: Use the Customers menu to manage renter profiles. You can update contact information, verify documents, and view their rental history.

## 5. Reporting Accidents
If a customer reports an accident during their rental:
1. Go to **Accidents** and click **Report New Accident**.
2. Document the date, location, involved parties, and estimated costs.
3. Upload any supporting documents or photos.
