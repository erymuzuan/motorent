<objective>
Create the ExchangeRate entity and service that form the foundation for all multi-currency operations.

Purpose: RATE-01 (API fetch stub), RATE-02, RATE-03, RATE-04 (audit trail on payments) require an exchange rate entity with source tracking and audit trail. This plan creates the domain model and service layer that all other plans depend on.

Output: ExchangeRate entity, SQL table, ExchangeRateService with get/set/convert/fetch operations, ReceiptPayment audit fields.

  <action>
    Create ExchangeRate entity following the existing Entity base class pattern:

    1. Create `src/MotoRent.Domain/Entities/ExchangeRate.cs`:
       - Inherit from Entity
       - Properties: ExchangeRateId (int), Currency (string, default SupportedCurrencies.USD), BuyRate (decimal), Source (string, default "Manual"), EffectiveDate (DateTimeOffset), ExpiresOn (DateTimeOffset?), ApiRate (decimal?), Notes (string?), IsActive (bool, default true)
       - Override GetId()/SetId() to use ExchangeRateId
       - Add static class ExchangeRateSources with constants: Manual, API, Adjusted

    2. Add JsonDerivedType attribute to Entity.cs:
       - Add `[JsonDerivedType(typeof(ExchangeRate), nameof(ExchangeRate))]` to Entity class
       - Place after the Till entities section with comment "// Exchange rate entities"

    3. Create `database/tables/MotoRent.ExchangeRate.sql`:
       - Follow MotoRent.TillSession.sql pattern
       - Schema placeholder: [<schema>]
       - Computed columns for indexing: Currency (CHAR(3)), BuyRate (DECIMAL(18,4)), Source (NVARCHAR(20)), IsActive (BIT), EffectiveDate (DATETIMEOFFSET PERSISTED), ExpiresOn (DATETIMEOFFSET PERSISTED)
       - Json column, audit columns (CreatedBy, ChangedBy, CreatedTimestamp, ChangedTimestamp)
       - Create index IX_ExchangeRate_Currency_Active on ([Currency], [IsActive])
       - Create index IX_ExchangeRate_EffectiveDate on ([EffectiveDate])

    Use decimal(18,4) for BuyRate - rates like CNY need precision (e.g., 5.1234 THB per CNY).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `dotnet build src/MotoRent.Domain` compiles without errors
    - ExchangeRate.cs exists with all required properties
    - Entity.cs has JsonDerivedType attribute for ExchangeRate
    - SQL file follows the established pattern
  </verify>
  <done>
    ExchangeRate entity exists with BuyRate, Currency, Source, EffectiveDate properties. Entity.cs includes polymorphism attribute. SQL table script ready for deployment.

  <files>
    src/MotoRent.Services/ExchangeRateService.cs
    src/MotoRent.Server/Program.cs
  </files>
  <action>
    Create ExchangeRateService following TillService pattern:

    1. Create `src/MotoRent.Services/ExchangeRateService.cs`:
       - Constructor: `ExchangeRateService(RentalDataContext context)`
       - Private property: `RentalDataContext Context { get; }`

       Methods to implement:

       a) `GetCurrentRateAsync(string currency)` -> `Task<ExchangeRate?>`
          - Query for active rate where Currency matches, EffectiveDate <= now, and (ExpiresOn is null OR ExpiresOn > now)
          - Use Context.LoadOneAsync with predicate

       b) `GetAllCurrentRatesAsync()` -> `Task<List<ExchangeRate>>`
          - Query active rates, ordered by Currency
          - Filter expired in memory (complex OR condition)
          - Return list of current rates for all currencies

       c) `SetRateAsync(string currency, decimal buyRate, string source, string username, decimal? apiRate = null, string? notes = null)` -> `Task<SubmitOperation>`
          - Get current rate for currency (if exists)
          - Create new ExchangeRate with provided values, IsActive = true, EffectiveDate = now
          - If current rate exists, set IsActive = false and ExpiresOn = now
          - Use Context.OpenSession(username), Attach both entities, SubmitChanges("SetExchangeRate")

       d) `ConvertToThbAsync(string currency, decimal foreignAmount)` -> `Task<ExchangeConversionResult?>`
          - Create a record type `ExchangeConversionResult(decimal ThbAmount, decimal RateUsed, string RateSource, int? ExchangeRateId)`
          - If currency is THB, return new ExchangeConversionResult(foreignAmount, 1.0m, "Base", null)
          - Get current rate for currency
          - If null, return null (no rate configured)
          - Calculate: thbAmount = foreignAmount * rate.BuyRate
          - Return new ExchangeConversionResult(thbAmount, rate.BuyRate, rate.Source, rate.ExchangeRateId)

       e) `GetRateHistoryAsync(string currency, int count = 10)` -> `Task<List<ExchangeRate>>`
          - Query rates for currency ordered by EffectiveDate descending
          - Useful for audit trail

       f) `FetchRatesFromApiAsync(string username)` -> `Task<FetchRatesResult>`
          - Create a record type `FetchRatesResult(bool Success, string Message, int RatesUpdated)`
          - **STUB IMPLEMENTATION:** Return new FetchRatesResult(false, "Forex POS API integration not yet configured. Contact system administrator.", 0)
          - Add XML doc comment: "/// <summary>Fetches exchange rates from the Forex POS API. Currently a stub - implementation pending API documentation from the forex system team.</summary>"
          - Add TODO comment: "// TODO: Implement when Forex POS API endpoint, auth method, and response format are documented"

    2. Register service in `src/MotoRent.Server/Program.cs`:
       - Add `builder.Services.AddScoped<ExchangeRateService>();`
       - Place near other service registrations (TillService, ReceiptService, etc.)

    NOTE: The FetchRatesFromApiAsync stub satisfies RATE-01 coverage. Per research findings (01-RESEARCH.md), the "Forex POS API" is an internal system without documented API. Manual rate entry is built first; API integration will be implemented when API details are available.

  <name>Task 3: Add audit fields to ReceiptPayment and register repository</name>
  <files>
    src/MotoRent.Domain/Entities/ReceiptPayment.cs
    src/MotoRent.Domain/DataContext/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs
  </files>
  <action>
    Add exchange rate audit fields to ReceiptPayment and register repository:

    1. Update `src/MotoRent.Domain/Entities/ReceiptPayment.cs`:
       Add the following properties after the existing ExchangeRate property (around line 33):

       ```csharp
       /// <summary>
       /// Source of the exchange rate used (Manual, API, Adjusted, or "Base" for THB)
       /// Captured at transaction time for RATE-04 audit trail requirement.
       /// </summary>
       public string ExchangeRateSource { get; set; } = "Base";

       /// <summary>
       /// Reference to the ExchangeRate entity used (null for THB base currency)
       /// Enables linking back to the exact rate record for audit purposes.
       /// </summary>
       public int? ExchangeRateId { get; set; }
       ```

       These fields capture RATE-04: "Exchange rate is stored on each transaction for audit trail."
       The existing Currency, ExchangeRate, and AmountInBaseCurrency fields store the values.
       The new ExchangeRateSource and ExchangeRateId fields provide the audit trail linkage.

    2. Open `src/MotoRent.Domain/DataContext/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
       Find the section where repositories are registered (look for `AddSingleton<IRepository<...>>`)
       Add: `services.AddSingleton<IRepository<ExchangeRate>, Repository<ExchangeRate>>();`

       If ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs doesn't have repository registrations, check Program.cs for the pattern and add there instead.

    After adding the registration, verify the full build:
    - All projects compile
    - No missing type errors
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `dotnet build` (full solution) compiles without errors
    - ReceiptPayment.cs has ExchangeRateSource and ExchangeRateId properties
    - Repository registration exists for ExchangeRate
    - ExchangeRateService can be resolved from DI (implicit from build success)
  </verify>
  <done>
    ReceiptPayment entity has ExchangeRateSource and ExchangeRateId fields for audit trail. ExchangeRate repository registered. Full solution builds successfully. Foundation layer complete and ready for UI plans.
  </done>
</task>
